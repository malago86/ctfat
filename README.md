## Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) Analysis Tool

We present an automated analysis tool designed to generate reproducible Contrast Transfer Functions (CTFs) for various types of Head-Mounted  Displays (HMDs). This CTF analysis tool processes acquired images from the HMD display. To compute the CTF of the HMD, a grille pattern with alternating black and white bars of equal width (either in the vertical or horizontal direction) is displayed on the HMD screen. The varying  widths of these bars correspond to different spatial frequency values, representing cycles per degree, which allow for the measurement of  Michelson contrast at these spatial frequencies. This tool is developed as a general method that can be applied to a wide variety of HMDs,  encompassing different design and display technologies, enabling the generation of reproducible CTFs.
